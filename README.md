Going to start with a counter first.
Eventual goal is to have something I can deploy to the google play store.

Here are some resources for me to keep track of:
https://docs.expo.io/distribution/building-standalone-apps/
https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/
https://docs.expo.io/distribution/introduction/

https://reactnative.dev/docs/tutorial
Counter app tried, failed
